Plotly: For creating interactive and visually appealing plots and charts.
SciPy: For performing scientific and statistical computations.
Streamlit: For building a user-friendly and interactive web application.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Features
The project includes the following features:

A histogram showing the distribution of vehicle types vs price.
A histogram showing the distribution of transmission types.
A histogram showing the distribution of fuel types.
A scatterplot showing the relationship between price and odometer reading.
An interactive histogram showing the price distribution between fuel types.
